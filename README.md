# Dollor-Rate-Converter
This is a simple project in python script that uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a currency converter. When you run this script, it will open a window with two input fields (for the exchange rate and the amount in USD), a "Convert" button, and a label that displays the result of the conversion.

When you enter values into the exchange rate and amount in USD fields and click the "Convert" button, the convert function will be executed. This function will retrieve the values from the input fields, perform the calculation, and update the label with the result. If an error occurs (e.g., if the user enters an invalid value), a message indicating that the input is invalid will be displayed.

Once the script is run, the main event loop (root.mainloop()) is started, which allows the GUI to respond to user events (such as clicking the "Convert" button). The GUI will remain open until the user closes it.
